Dog's Life. Hate it. I hate it very much. I am looking forward to the day I'll retire from this job.

And now, onto the brighter side of things..&nbsp; :) 
Just cant believe that its been around 95 days since i joined amazon.com.. time just flies. Come to think of it, havent learnt much (yet!) .. maybe we spend too much time on TT and vetti chat! :D
Only one line of technical stuff - Ruby seems to be a much better language than python..!! Been using that for tasks that could be done with the CL itself :)) ( Ok, maybe I am not yet proficient in them :P ) 

The 'Bangalore witches' seem to be having the time of their lives (%$%$# !! *#$*^!!) from staying in the same house, cooking their own meals (though their experiments at kitchen doesn't seem to have produced anything even ordinary yet!), city-(sight?)-seeing on weekends and first day shows of movies!! 

Saw LOTR only a coupla weekes back :D and promptly bought 'The Silmarillion' at LandMark last weekend.. along with Tell No One and Twilight (yes, that novel many think is gonna beat Potter). Read Tell.., yet to&nbsp; read the others..! 

Nothing more to add.. though I always wonder on weekends on how that week had passed and what I had done besides staring at a flat screen for about 10 hrs a day, I get a fat pay and life would probably start rocking once I start managing time efficiently. 

Hoping to find some time atleast in the coming weeks to write a meaningful post or atleast a lengthier post (like Birth of the Consortium, Feb 2008) :D :D 

Cheers
