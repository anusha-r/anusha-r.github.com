the title should be clear enough.. most classes of sixth sem ended today..

have 3 lab exams next week from mon to wed and semester starts on april 19.. :) this sem is easily the worst in 3 years, my internals are all well below what i had in prev sems.. very poor performance.. would attribute it to my unwavering overconfidence :P

well, more than anything else, this is the pre placement sem, this gpa would be taken into account for placement cgpa.. so am looking at nothing short of 9.5 ( atleast fantasizing as of now..)   Managed to get an A+  for the chatbot submitted for web tech project.. gr8 team effort ;)

still have graphics, C#  and graph projects to do.. that wud keep me occupied this weekend..

cheers,
