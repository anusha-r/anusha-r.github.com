<p class="snap_preview">hi all,</p>
been wanting to post about this for a long time, found the time only now..

whew, wat a week tat was.. got a mail saying Google is looking for interns from my coll.. sent my resume and the phone interviews were scheduled for april 20..

only one took place on april 20, the other was rescheduled to april 23, but i never got that call.. maybe they dint want to waste time on me after tat miserable performance in round I <img src="https://anushar.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt="P" class="wp-smiley" />

i was asked only 2 questions.

snip snip!!! questions deleted after hearing that one of my seniors got a mail from Google asking him not to put up questions on blogs..
Got the expected ‘NO’ on last friday.. and wasnt feeling that bad about it until i read that ‘Programming pearls’ book.. oh gawd!! both questions were in that book, with different solutions.. had wanted to read that book for some time now, but WHY dint i read it before Google’s interview?!! atleast i could have received a second call.. Duh!

So, thats two down– versata &amp; google. Seems Microsoft is coming for interns next month.. lets see if i am third time lucky.. <img src="https://anushar.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=")" class="wp-smiley" />
