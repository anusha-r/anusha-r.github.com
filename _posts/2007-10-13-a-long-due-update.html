back after abt two months.. :)
<p>
jus going to rant about my TC losses..
<p>
my TC has been dropping consistently for the past 2 months.. however easy the problems, i manage to lose everything to challenges!! and shaastra was a waste of time,  we dint even try hard.. i realise i'm getting complacent, but i jus hope i get outta this soon.. (i shd, cos i got a zero again in today's SRM )
<p>
leaving for iitk on oct 24, hope we do really well there!! ok, i dont trust myself, but my team mates have been working hard and they are passionate abt this!! ;)  . Four teams, but 4 witches among them, its going to be a great trip!!
<p>
for the brighter side of the past two months.. it hasnt been bright, but one or two things we're happy with: we did prodigy's debugging event, our first 'big' event.. the response from participants was ok but others comments were not, but who is bothered abt them!! :P  And we may end up doing an event for Sync.. and we have managed to get quite a 'good' name for ourselves when it comes to conducting events!!
<p>
Our idea of bringing more girls into ACM is definitely going to take us to higher places , even though they dont seem to be learning anything from us. preparing for girls acm, getting angry abt the poor turnout, classes for 3rd girls, and poor attendance in even tat has become regular in the last 2 months..
<p>
Ah, jus saw the division summary for today's SRM.. must be my worst performance in 23 matches!! i have been putting off preparing for TC for so many weeks now, hope this makes me  take  TC seriously..
<p>
Wanted to write a BIG post but this has really put me off, will edit or write a new one some other time.  Navarathiri is here and  is going on great as usual, wonder where we wud be same time next year!!
<p>
cheers,
