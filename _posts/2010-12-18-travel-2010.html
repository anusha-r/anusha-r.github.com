Bad bad wordpress. I was close to completing my first version of this post and you din't even autosave it! Hmpff.
<p>
So I was saying 2008 had atleast one post. I think it started with the phrase "Dog's life" which has become (in)famous at work. Never mind ;) it really is.. :P
2009 was about the accident. I prefer to call it my promotion to being an ace driver. The car din't overturn you know.. even our chauffeur-on-hire agreed it was one thing doing an accident, but a different thing to come out unscratched ;)
<p>
Let me record my travels for 2010. And one great year of travel adventures it was!!
So, another dream of a lifetime came true.. of visiting the US of A! By pure chance, I was chosen to go and be sidekick to one of my team mate on a project at our company's cupertino office! After scraping through the visa interview and the tougher and deciding immigration office interview at SFO airport, I was there! And what a trip it was.. made memorable - a small part was because it was a childhood dream and in a big part due to the company I had whilst there - Surendran and Rajasimman from my office were there during my stay. We also had company in the form of ceg people who happened to be there in bay area at that time, as well as senior Prashanth who is studying at Berkeley.
<p>
Highlights of this trip in chrono order -
- Landing at SFO. The immigration officer was furious I asked for a 3 month stay. "What business needs 3 months" Me: <em>Repeating an answer I had already been told to rehearse well, by the main developer</em> "I'm here to attend meetings, gather requirements and undergo training for a new project on a new domain". Officer:"I cant believe this. Explain what a business is" I was seriously cooking up a definition for 'business' but caught myself in the nick of time - he actually approved it immediately after asking so. Perhaps my sincere attempt to answer his question on business pleased him ;) Atleast my manager's predictions dint come true - he was sure I would be denied visa either at the embassy in Chennai or the immigration desk at SFO (I can almost see you sympathize with me - the types I work under - <em>I know..</em>) :D
- Taxiing to sunnyvale and checking in. Suren and I were trying to figure out where the taxi stand was, in the airport, when some elderly man came out of somewhere and literally pulled our luggages along with him, claiming to be a cab driver. And of course, in good trust we followed him silently :D After many doors and floors in elevator, he left us in the car park and went back into the airport. He later rteurned with some more folks - turns out he was a private and had found us and another family for the same destination. And continuing the trust, we sat silently in the back and went with him un questioningly :D Turned out to be not bad and even gave us a advice that McD's "sweet teas" were very good and the $1 charge for infinite refills was just cost effective. He even offered us a 10% discount if we called him while going back to airport.
It turned out we had to bring money with us and pay for the hotel in cash. Both Suren and I did not know this. We only had some 'prepaid corporate credit cards' which weren;t yet active. After quite a tensed account of how we had no money with us (to the hotel staff-yes!) we managed to get a corporate travel desk person to talk and convince the hotel fellas that we'll pay in 1-2 days (that we dint pay for 10-12 days more, Suren's card never got activated, etc are other stories).
Not to mention the Lee's sandwich the main developer had saved for me for lunch that day - YUCK! and the dinner (at 6:30!) at Brittania Pub (I know!). Terrible. Patties were just yuck, breads just huge, drinks just cold and large, fries just large and lot in number. I was already hating US.
- Palani from my office was there during my first week of stay and took us out to shops like REI, the golden gate bridge and malls in SFO and a hike in a nearby hill. It was a nice prelude to our forthcoming exciting trips. We also picked up the habit of jump-poses for facebook profile pics here and continued it religiously on every weekend trip after that :)

- We were on our own from weekend 2. Suren rented a car and our first long one was a drive on US1 and half moon bay. Those cold waters, scenic cliffs all along the way, the nice road and chill wind.. wow. 
- Weekend 3 was a trip to Lake Tahoe. The long drive, and us armed with bags of pringles, juices, chess men.. having to remember to wear seat belt, even though I was sitting in the back seat.. those distant, huge mountains with snow capped peaks, the clear blue water.. It is such a nice place. Wonder how nice it would be in snow - the main developer has been lucky enough to do that too! **** him.

- Weekend 4 saw a trip to Yosemite with Prashanth. Such beautiful waterfalls, the rainbow in the spray, us trying to capture it without damaging the lens with the spray, those steep steps - I wouldn't have made this without the helping hand of the main developer of course :D And of course, Suren feeling sorry that we woke up so early to make this trip that I wouldn't have had time for make-up (Such damage!)

- Weekend 5 was a lite one before the big bite. We went to San Luis reservoir, followed by a hike at some hill near that place.
- Weekend 6 was a long one and the best. We drove first to Needles, then through deserts which would make perfect settings for cowboy stories, to Las Vegas! We stayed at Stratosphere and had a nice time walking to the main places. 
We first went shopping in LV (yes :) I bought those bigg coolers for 12$ there. and I dont think I'll ever wear them in India. :D
Then we did a six hour hike in this concrete and adult jungle ;) .. and saw erupting volcanoes, pirate ship, musical fountains, eiffel tower and statue of liberty on the way. (I'm referring to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Las_Vegas_Strip_panorama.jpg">the strip</a>). We returned back to the hotel at 2 am and promptly proceeded to the casino. Suren and Prashanth pooled in 5$ each and made upto 20$ before coming down to 5$ again :) 
We then left for Grand canyon from LV. Traffic near hoover dam area delayed us for some time.. after snacks at hoover dam, we proceeded onto GC, but reached it a little after sunset; the original plan was to start back to Needled that evening but now we had to stay until morning to see the canyon. After much hunting., we found a room (and more importantly, a parking slot for the car). The next day we drove around to our heart's content in that area and reached sunnyvale after a looong drive... Credits to Suren and Prashanth on the safe n long drive.

- Weekend 7 was another lite one, with us visiting Intel museum and then a walk along the golden gate bridge.
- Weekend 8 was another awesome one - Disneeeeeeeeeeeeeyland! We took a bus down to LA and visited Disneyland and Universal Studios. It was a great experience to see so much of technology in Univ studios.. how cool would it be to work at such a place ;) wonder what one needs to do to get a job there. The pizzeria guy there had a shock on seeing the amount of stuff we ordered ;) He actually asked how many people we ordered it for :D

- Suren returned after this. We hatad one more weekend (we just went to raavan - whatey movie!) and then the main developer and I returned too.
<p>
Great trip it was.. so muuuuuuch of pizzas and soft drinks..but the regular hikes actually helped me lose some weight, which I very promptly regained on returning home :( The balanced life - one thing at a time at work, not working on weekends - was great. Wonder why work time and load back here is so much worse, but then that's another story.
<p>
The past few months have seen the usual road trips to Srirangam. We also visited a lot of temples in the past few months - one to Rameshwaram to do some parikaram and seek blessings of our ancestors. We had many relatives for company here and it was quite fun. 
 Another was to Srimushnam via Neyveli. The deity in Srimushnam temple is Varaha - guess this is the only temple with Vishnu in such a form. The deity is a small one, with the face of pig. Nice big temple with less crowd- the way a temple should be ;)
<p>
And topping it all, the year end saw a week off in Karnataka - with relatives again. We visited Mysore, Nanjangodu, Thala cauvery, Coorg, Hosanadu, Halebid, Belur, Udupi and finally back to Mysore. Much of it was in a tavera, along winding roads in the western ghats.. and listening to vishnu sahasranamam everyday.. discussions about mahabharatha.. nice break from work it was.

2011 is here.. hope I have a good year in travel once again. With atleast one intl trip, of course ;)
