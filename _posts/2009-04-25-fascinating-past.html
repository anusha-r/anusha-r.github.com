Peeping into this space after some time, with no idea of what to say.

Just completed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sivagamiyin_Sabadham">'sivagaiyin sabatham'</a>. That set me thinking - well, before that, it set me crying  and then, from pitying sivagami, wondering at her acceptance of her fate - (the climax was nicely written, I liked this story better than<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponniyin_Selvan"> 'ponniyin selvan'</a>)  to thinking about the history of tamil nadu to what we are now and to wishing to live in the times of kings and empires ;)

I either am at a loss for words today or there are many things that I dont know how to say - I do remember crying after 'ponniyin selvan' but that was more about having to depart all those characters - I was completele immersed in it for about 15-20 days during my annual holidays in 2002. I only remember wanting to visit the Big Temple at Thanjavur after reading that novel, and fantasizing about living at those times, etc :)  After this one, my desire is to live at some place of historical importance and devote all my time to reading the scriptures on the temple walls :D (Ok, I did want to be an astronomer after seeing Halley's Comet about a decade back, a journalist after someone told me my written english is good, but I think I really want to read the writings on temple walls :)) ) Just want to record my reaction to this book here - when I look at sivagami - how she grew in the years she was imprisoned, how she accepted her fate and devotes herself to her art - especially the climax where she becomes a temple dancer and doesnt even sense her former lover, the king watching her from the audience. She finally devots herself to what she loves doing the most. Look at the king and his father before him - through the sculptures and rock temples at Mamallapuram they have earned a name for eternity. Most important of all - think about the person who wrote this great book - what efforts he must have put into researching this, to bring people from 7th century A.D alive before our eyes.. I would like very muchto research this and find out how many of the characters are for real.

When I think about how many centuries those temples have been here for, I also wonder about the explosions in many fields in the recent few years, and about what is to come in the next few centuries. Human life is way too short to follow all this action :) I'm going to miss out a lot of action, but then right now, (I'm sure my recent frustrations at the stagnation in life and the inertia against experimenting contribute to this train of thought) I do want to something. something big. something that touches other lives. or atleast something that I enjoy doing.

But whatever it is, I want to record here (lest I forget post retirement that I planned at 22, to visit temples at leisure :D) the past fascinates me. This book is based on a real war from the 7th century , but what of the many thousands of years before this? what is the earliest written recording of early human life? It would be greatly interesting to research on those lines ;)

Let me stop fantasizing here :))

I'm confused about life currently- it seems way too boring for me. Am hoping my month long vacation starting the same day, next month has something interesting to offer.  (but what could a silly vacation possibly do to my attitude.. let me just hope! ) 
cheers.
