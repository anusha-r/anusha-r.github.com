random quote from the web -<h4>thoughtful<span> thoughts</span></h4>
<span></span> 		Everything that I've learned about computers at MIT I have boiled down into three principles: Unix: You think it won't work, but if you find the right wizard, he can make it work. Macintosh: You think it will work, but it won't. PC/Windows: You think it won't work, and it won't.
