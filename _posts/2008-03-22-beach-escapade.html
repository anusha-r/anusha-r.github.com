[ An account of the wonderful (at least according to me) trip by 32 AB batchers to Mahabalipuram... ]
<p>
The background - my classmates had gone for  a customary industrial visit in aug 2006 (i found a convenient reason to stay at home with my good <b>old</b> computer! :D ) and had enjoyed it thoroughly. Another IV was planned for the final year but there were no signs of it taking off.. so it came down to an one day trip to somewhere, sometime in april. Now this somewhere-sometime plan did take off and we were all informed just 2 days before the trip. Anyways, we witches are eager as always for an outing and in my case, more than other things, it was another-escapade-from-this-horrible-fyp :) Need say more?
<p>
The trip -  The bus trip does deserve a mention - they brought to light <b>the photograph</b>er in Karthika and my camera was in the limelight for some time!! :P :P Wat a pic!! :D Beats all the 'thirutu' pics we had taken in icpc s / abacus :D
<p>
We went to the lighthouse first. Whew! we girls are no <a href="http://thecyberian.wordpress.com/2008/03/20/mountaineering-is-fun/" target="_blank">mountain goats</a> and we had a tough time climbing and sliding down those slopes.  Weren't the guys helping you out, you might ask.. no, as always :P  And after this trekking exercise we went to the  famed "Pancha Pandava Rathas" area. Photo sessions were on in full swing in the area. After many requests and threats, some ( not all, "Mind It!" :D ) ppl consented for a group photo and the result is here:

Grr. Horns on my head. x(
<p>
Lunch was good, the only time we spent under a roof. And the best part of the trip came after this. I thought we were going boating in muthukadu (at least that was part of the plan) but then, the bus simply stopped somewhere along the road, and there it was - the beach, a short walk through a "savuku thoppu" to the deserted stretch of sand.
<p>
We spent the usual half hour in the water with Maha staying on dry land as always. The boys had brought balls and bats and playing cards (yes, cards on the beach - tats AB batch guys for you :P ) . There were seven girls - 5 witches (madam greenie aka aruna had gone to Google Blore! ^:)^ ) and 2 angels (angels + witches = ab batch girls, and we are very much united, thank you!! ). we started with a game of dodge ball (reminded me of my ncc camp :) ).
<p>
Pics:  Game in progress !

We then had the time of our lives playing throw ball, lock and key :D It was nice to play these games after a long time.. the last time most of us had played was at school. And then it was time to drag Maha into the water.. she overcame her fear within seconds and started wading deeper in to the water, while we had to pull her back!! :))
<p>
Not to mention the dance 'step' and 'music' we learnt from hostellers and did a jig on the beach. And the 'train' we formed and ran around our very own treasurer of csea!! :))
<p>
After beach it was a walk in to the village nearby in search of water. We started by around 6 and were back at the college by 7 p.m.
<p>
And the very next day, everyone was asking for <b>that photo</b>!! :D That sure was one of the highlights of the day..
<p>
My last trip with classmates was way back in 1998 to the same place - mahabalipuram. Had the same amount of fun this time too, especially playing those games on the beach!!
<p>
And yes, a special note of thanks to arun, from witches and angels alike, for staying back all the time to see if the girls are safe.
<p>
So when is the next trip? We want the ball this time too!! :D
<p>
cheers
