Its exactly a week after 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows' release and i would say the series deserves a more action-packed, thrilling end than this. To be frank, none of the books after GoF lived up to my expectations, but this one being the last part, could have been better. Though there are relevations about the past, the book seemed to lack something.. every chapter just takes us towards a predictable end ( forgive me if i have missed anything, but the book simply isnt that interesting.. even hp 5 was better) .
<p>
come to think of it, i cant remember seeing anything abt Sirius anywhere in the book.. everyone seems to have forgotten that character.. Anyway, nothing can be done about it now and 'Undesirable Number One' will live on as one of the most popular fictional characters ever [:d]
<p>
and now i am switching to ubuntu and continue my tinkering ( which has resulted in uninstalling the gdm twice, misuse of apt-get and many 'serious warning's from apt-get :)) until now)
