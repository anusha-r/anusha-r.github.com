Yes, I'm terribly shaken after the accident we had yesterday. (Not at a loss for words though :D)
<p>
So we bought a Chevrolet Spark last year, just before diwali. Though my mother and I weren't very keen on buying a car then, we've had a very good run with it. We have been going around TN atleast once in a month or so, and each trip has been a very memorable and comfortable experience. And somewhere along the way, I learnt enough to drive it on the highways (but changing gears and starting using gear 1 are still a problem for me). My father has also improved his driving skills and for the past 2-3 times we have been driving it ourselves in long distance trips.
<p>
Yesterday being Diwali, we decided to visit my grandma who is living at Trichy. It was supposed to be just an overnight stay there and a 'good' driving practise for me. After our share of guests from Diwali had left, we started at around 4 o clock (and post accident we have agreed we shouldn't have started this late or atleast hired a driver for night driving). At around 5.30 I took over the car from my father (I don't drive anywhere even in the suburb of Chennai :D) and continued at a little over 90 on NH45.
<p>
My father started to relax and put in a hindi song cd in the car's (dabba) player. I kept pestering him to put in a tamil cd for a long time. This started a speech from my father on the importance of knowing hindi to survive anywhere in India. All this while I was driving on the rightmost lane, on the 5th gear and at &gt; 90 kmph (all of these things I have never done before). Then started a session of learning the meaning for some hindi words I have heard often (eg: 'Junoon' - the soap on DD i remember being addicted to, 'Anjana' - while the player was playing 'Tere mere beach mein', etc). Slowly my concentration shifted to re-collecting hindi words rather than the road. 
<p>
I only remember the next few seconds as few stills from a thriller movie's trailer. 
Out of nowhere a median came into view - my car was moving so that the right tyre would definitely hit it. My father shouted out and I steered the wheel completely to the left - the car turned a full 90 degrees to the left (I was in the rightmost lane - so now I was effectively blocking the whole road) - Before the car had even finished turning, I realised I had done this without checking if a vehicle was coming up from behind on the next lane, so instinctively, I turned the wheel to the right again (towards the median)! The car turned more than 90 degrees to the right, so it directly hit the median (all this while still going at 100km - it never crossed me mind to hit the brake).
<p>
The car hit the median and my mind went blank for a second (actually everyone in the car went silent). The front tyre on the right, under the driver came free of the car, complete with a huge spring and ran away in the darkness into the opposite side of the road.
My mind was slowly coming back to senses - my train of thought was : "why is the car jumping up and down - something is wrong - what is it - why are there plants appearing right in front of my car the headlights - oh no, half of my car is running on the median - wait, someone is shouting - its my father - he asks me to slow down - yes, where is the brake?' - I hit all three pedals one by one while I waited for my mind, which was in a 'this is definitely some scene that I'm seeing on a 3D screen at an amusement park' attitude, to decide on which pedal the brake is. I finally found it and hit it hard. The car veered off the median and with a lot of sparks, came to rest almost in the middle of the road. 
<p>
The door on my side was damaged by the impact and took some time to open. While I tried to, a lot of sparks were flying out of the place where the wheel had once been (that part had dragged on the median for such a long time) that I thought the car had caught fire. 
<p>
In under a minute, many people came onto the road to help us (of course, you will know that passing cars wont stop, except to just get a good look of the damaged car). We were told we were on the bridge on River Kedilam (of Ponniyin Selvan fame), 24 kms from Villupuruam (and it seems this bridge is actually known for accidents since its the narrowest stretch on the whole chennai - trichy route). We also realised that had I not turned my car sharply the second time ( after I had realised I had blocked the road at 90 degrees), if we had taken any amount to time to hit the brake, we would have jumped right into the empty river! 
<p>
After some calls to nearby mechanic shops and a tow-vehicle hiring shop, my father and I rememebered to ask my mother if she was ok. Both of us sitting in the front were completely unaffected, except for the shock, but it seems my mother had been thrown against the doors, each one at the two sharp turnings I did, and she had a terrible pain in her right arm. One of the locals brought his wife and mother-in-law to the spot and took my mother to a nearby hospital with their help. My father and I waited with 3 other villagers until the tow van arrived. 
<p>
If you dint know this before - there are solar-powered emergency phone booths all along the way on that highway. You can ask for assistance at the press of a button. One of the villagers called the highway patrol from this phone and they were on the spot to assess the damage in minutes - THAT WAS QUICK. The patrol folks arranged for a red signals to be put up.  They had a digital camera (of a higher range than mine :D) that they used to take pics of damaged vehicles. He showed us pics of accidents that had happened just 1-2 hours before us - one even had a picture of the driver lying in a pool of blood. We were all continually reminded by them as to how lucky we really had been - no other vehicle had come up threateningly close behind us - else he would have hit us when we steered off the median and probably sent us flying down the opposite lane, we had steered back toward the median from the left end of the road, otherwise we would have gone flying into the sand bed (making this kollywood style accident into a hollywood-styled one!)  Soon after the patrol, the tow vehicle arrived and so did my mother. We decided to tow it to Pondycherry (1 hour from that spot) so that my uncle there could help us repair it. He was actually at Trichy when this accident happened, and waiting for us, so we made him come to this spot to pick us up. One by one, the villagers took leave, once again reminding us of our good luck. And every single one of them refused to take any money in return for their help..!!
<p>
After our car was towed away, we waited at a nearby bus stop for my uncle (the place was 2 hours from Trichy). Three people sitting in an unlit area, on a piece of median called a bus stop, with a lot of luggage - it must have really been a sight. And to pass on time, my father spoke on astrology and how <em>jathagams</em> are calculated, how this accident might have been foreseen, how his <em>chadrastamam</em> the next day may have been the cause, etc etc :D 
<p>
The accident happened around 7.15. We reached Pondycherry at around 12 midnight and returned to Chennai today. The car will be at Pondy for some more time - poor thing.
<p>
Whatey night and whatey diwali! I have been advised to drive 'carefully' next time - seriously folks, its going to take me years to recover from this thriller of a ride and hold a car steady.
<p>
It is ironic that on the way, I was actually thinking that I hadn't posted in a long time and that I should probably be writing about these nice car trips ('Chevy trips' I call these). I had even thought of saying "Its a year since we bought a car and I have learnt to drive on the highways, only the city of Chennai is left for me to learn to drive, but I'm not too keen.. blah..blah.."
<p>
Whew! Lucky stars or lucky angels  (I even had a 'lucky hanky' when I was in my ninth standard) - whatever it is, now I know I have them in plenty!
<p>
