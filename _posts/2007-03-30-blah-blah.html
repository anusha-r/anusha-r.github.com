am back after a loong time..

third assess is goin on and have scored the least possible marks in  the second assesss :P .. wonder why i have lost that seriousness and become so over confident, especially in this pre-placement sem.. wonder where this attitude will take me in three months' time.. ( :| )

but speaking abt the projects i have moaned about for a long time in my blog, most of them are near completion:

my graph proj computer chess seems to be a minor hit with the other girls of my class, even though its still buggy and only 20 % of the computer part is complete... ( :P ) hope we put on a good show b4 mam on tues.. this weekend will be spent on that, i suppose..  and as of now, jus planning to find code for graphics proj from the net ( ;) ).. shouldnt be difficult ( :P ).. and the Chat Bot i did in the fifth sem hols will be my web tech proj.. am really angry at having had to use all those nice ideas for such sem projects :( ..should spend this summer on doing something really big..

*wrote this post simply bcause i hadnt come here in a long time.. :P

cheers,
