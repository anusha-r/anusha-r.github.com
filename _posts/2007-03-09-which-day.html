<pre>"what day of the week was
July 8, 1954,"  what formula would you use to answer the question
(possibly in your head) without looking at a calendar?</pre>
<pre> :) </pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>Here is a standard method suitable for mental computation:

(1) Take the last two digits of the year.
(2) Divide by 4, discarding any fraction.
(3) Add the day of the month.
(4) Add the month's key value: JFM AMJ JAS OND: 144 025 036 146
(5) Subtract 1 for January or February of a leap year.
(6) For a Gregorian date, add 0 for 1900's, 6 for 2000's,
    4 for 1700's, 2 for 1800's; for other years, add or subtract
    multiples of 400.
(7) For a Julian date, add 1 for 1700's, and 1 for every additional
    century you go back.
(8) Add the last two digits of the year.
(9) Divide by 7 and take the remainder.

Now 1 is Sunday, the first day of the week, 2 is Monday, and so on.</pre>
<pre> The example of July 8, 1954, would go like this:

   (1) 54
   (2) 54/4 = 13
   (3) 13 + 8 = 21
   (4) 21 + 0 = 21
   (5) 21 - 0 = 21
   (6) 21 + 0 = 21
   (8) 21 + 54 = 75
   (9) 75 - 7*10 = 5 &lt;--&gt; Thursday.</pre>
