At long last, my biggest wish has come true.... we always travel a lot during summer.. but this time its an escape to the scenic and serene city of Edinburgh :D :D :D :D :D 
<p>We started on may 25, sunday on the 8am BA flight and after an uneventful flight (in which I watched The Reader and The Curious Case..) we landed at heathrow at around 7pm that day. London was beautiful from the skies, with almost all houses of the same dimensions and neatly arranged in semicircles and large patches of green everwhere. We also flew over Dubai around midday and that was again awesome from the skies.. the whole area had a lot of rectangles without even a single green speck. The coatlines were again so beautiful to look at from the top. It's a pity I dint have my camera with me then.. my #^%&amp;^# cell phone has no bluetooth, no slot/cable to connect to a pc and not even an expandable memory, photos just overwrite the old ones without even prompting me. Pshaw!
<p>London airport was a bit eventful :D At security check, everyone had to remove boots and belts, but a few had to remove more than that :D I escaped with just removing my belt, but still.. :P And then we went to a coffee shop and had english tea (it tastes much worse than I one I make) for Â£1.x... my mother has vowed not to drink tea at any shop in England after seeing the bill :)) 
The London-Edinburgh flight was again an beautiful one, we flew over land and water alternatively. Edinburgh's airport itself is located amidst mountains and is a very green and windy city. I have just gone to a couple of markets and some walks in the neighbourhood and so far its been a peaceful city.. every house has a neat garden with beautiful flowers like we have seen at our own kodaikanal flower show.. 
<p>We'll be going to a a few castles and glens :D around here and then London next week.. but I think we wouldnt be able to make it to the Loch Ness... :(
<p>I'll finally have some time and am planning to catch up on topcoder, my google reader stuff and do something for my mentor meetings at work.... ha ha, did I say I'm on vacation here?!!

cheers,
anusha.
