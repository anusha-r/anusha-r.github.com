hi,

comin back after a long time i guess..  have been busy with mipt for two days.. solved 24 as of now, much more to do..

finally all project submissions are over .. got an A+ for our 'alien invasion' XNA game.. :) and semester starts from this thursday..  two days to go

meanwhile i have started looking at interview questions for placements and internships.. pretty interesting thing to do, too bad i dint start last summer.. there is simply so much to learn..

just came online to receive birthday wishes.. yup, turned twenty today.. year of placement.. should get into a DJ :D

happy bday to me!! :)

cheers,

anusha
