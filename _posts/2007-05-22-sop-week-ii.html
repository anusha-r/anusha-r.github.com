hi there..

hmm.. i started this 'SoP -week' set of updates so that these wud make me serious once in a while.. but to no avail..Â  i still spend time wid some simple spoj prob, code an outrageous solution, get a <strong>WA</strong> and switch off the system .. :P

Many companies were rumoured to come for interns but i guess i am simply not prepared for placements.. shd spend the time properly..

not to mention this fyp 'thedal' as mam put it.. heard the word virtualization somewhere and have already started dreaming abt the future of my fyp.. the truth is i am simply doing everything i can to avoid searching for this :P (like updating my blog when i am to meet tomorrow with 2 'proposals' !!! :D )

ok, must get going.. and results will be out any time now (shudder!!) Easily my worst sem .. and like all other semesters, this sem again i'll really work hard towards getting some really good gpa..!! :)

cheers,

anusha
