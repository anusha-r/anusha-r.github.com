yippee..!! we have finally managed to get the top prize in a tech event.. we have come first in the c debugging (brain bytes) contest conducted by the ECE department of my college....!! and the prize money is a cool 2000 bucks..!!
<p>
the prelims were held yesterday.. the questions seem to have been picked right out of the 'test ur c skills' book by yashwant kanetkar.. thanx to aruna's and jai's idea of spending the compilers class with that book under the desk, we managed to enter the finals..
<p>
we had to solve 4 problems in 1 hour in the finals.. we were given the questions in a print out and were asked to show output like in a lab exam..the questions were:
<p>
1. reverse the order of words in a sentence. eg:
<p>
'the quick brown fox' becomes 'fox brown quick the'
<p>
2. the program takes an arithmetic expression as input and prints the  result. eg:
<p>
2+3*5 gives 17
<p>
3. write a program to print the numbers in a square matrix in a spiral  traversal.
<p>
4. add 2 numbers,number of digits can be upto 20.
<p>
all 5 teams managed to solve three (four of us were from cse - 3 from mit and us).. we were getting a partial output for prob 3.. the judge wasn't too particular about the input..just asked us about the logic and let us off.  we weren't confident of getting the first place and purposefully avoided  going near the audi ;) . finally we had to call the senior out and get the certificates and money..
<p>
so......... i have just earned a 1000 bucks.. ;)
<p>
and i had my placement training program today.. nothing much, just a mr.k.r.subramani speaking to us about effective communication and team building skills..was very enjoyable, especially the india-srilanka-bdesh-pak saarc nations  game we played :D
<p>
and now am signing off.. whew, what a tiring day its been..
<p>
cheers,
anusha.
