thanx to all those academic projects that have been dumped on us, i spent the day running behind teachers to ask for their approval on topics/team..and how sad the consequences have been..
<p>
it so happens that my college is  home to some other creatures other than <a href="mailto:%20maharam_cs@yahoo.co.in">nerds</a> and ordinary ppl like me.. and these creatures ( genus: Cercopithecus) are not like those found in other places, they attend classes too, which also causes our teachers to wrongly conclude they are doing a great job :))
<p>
so when i returned to my class to pick up my bag, after having run behind mam to ask about team size, my worst fears were confirmed.. one big monkey was sitting near the entrance and one more near my open bag.. not to mention jayalakshmi and aruna bravely ;)  trying to shoo away that particular one and trying to save about four bags lying around them.. but the primate could not shift his eyes away from aruna's bright dress (:P), so they had to give uptrying to save the bags and get away from its clutches (not b4 aruna was almost maimed by it).. and after that, thanx to maha's timely entry with her brothers ;), we managed to shoo all three away and collect our bags..
<p>
and my bag was the most ransacked that day.. the monkey took my water bottle and spilled water over my bag; then he  pulled out my tiffin box ( yummy vathakuzhambu and vazhaipoo parupusili) and started eating.. but was lucky enof not to lose my purse and cell which were lying about loosely..
<p>
a horrible day to sum up.. poor aruna, she went home after getting first aid ( administered by the omniscient jai ;) ) . And in case you r wondering about the 'II' in the title, well, this thing has happened to me before.. in my first sem, when i had brought the same vathakuzhambu to college.. thats one of the negative sides of my mother being one of the best cooks i guess.. :)
<p>
And my C# project has been decided upon finally.. we will be doing a game for Xbox360 using the XNA game express..
<p>
so.. until we meet again folks,
<p>
cheers,
<p>
