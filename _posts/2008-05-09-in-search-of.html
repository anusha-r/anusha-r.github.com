<p style="text-align:left;">....someone's house somewhere on this planet!! (yeah, this planet only :D )</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">back after a loong time.. plenty of things to talk about..!!</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">1. college has ended. I dint feel anything special about last day, last exam, etc.. dunno why?!! slam books are making rounds, but the feeling hasn't sunk in yet.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">2. next phase of life begins on may 26 ;)</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">3. we are bidding adieu to the necessary evil called fyp on monday, may 12, when our external review ends. #:-S</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">4. what was i in search of,  today? or rather we.. Molly and I.. well, here goes.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">so i had this crush on Y. Y this, Y that, Y all the time.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">and finally i learned where Y lived.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">what better thing to do in hols, than to go in search of that place, that street and that house? :D</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I had been thinking about this for sometime, when along came Molly. For AI project. A deal was stuck - i'll do AI with you.. we'll go for a walk in this area!! :)  We decided to do that not-so-stupid (or is it?) thing today. We went to Barista for lunch - supposedly my treat for job, but she ended up paying as much as me :D</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">And yes, this post is more about Barista and less about Y :D Y will kill me if Y finds out about this post. Even otherwise Barista takes precedence :D .</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">We went to this hangout after college today. And spent a good ten minutes waiting for someone to take our orders, before we realised it is a 'self-service' center. Ha ha. Going through the list of drinks, i urged Molly tat it was my treat and she should get herself a good drink.  I have the bills with me.. Molly had a "Barista Balst" while I chose a "Barista Cookie Crunch".  The latter order made him look up ad say: "I'm warning you. Its a strong drink. We use tubed-ice (tats what i heard). I'm telling you because customers should not complain later". I wasn't going to stop for tat, so we went ahead and ordered it.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Yuucckkk. Only the cookies on top of the drink were eatable. The drink was ^#$^%#. Be warned, dont try that drink ever. After finishing half of it, i was wondering how Molly drank without complaining. Cos i dint realise only mine was this bad. And when we excahged the drinks, Molly almost spat it out. She is of the opinion its an alcoholic drink and that is what the man at counter was trying to convey. And yessss, being the good girl i am ;) i dint touch that drink after that. we decided to get something solid to eat, to come out of that taste of coffee for her and 'strongly alcoholic? drink' for me. 'Coffee and Almond Cake' for her and 'Chocolate Excess' for me. Pics below! :D</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Feast ur eyes!!</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">After chatting about nothing in particular for a while, we decided to hunt this landamrk X near which Y's house is supposed to be. And X was very near this barista. Only we dint know where exactly Y lived. I knew where Y's father worked but asking about that company's quarters only brought blank stares in return. (Later did i learn that that company dint have a quarters as such. 'What we find becomes quarters' Y said. Good ) :D</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">and Molly was more interested in seeing who this crush is, so she wudnt give up after that. We decided to turn back again and search on the other side of X. When Molly's slipper decided to prevent us from going any further. sigh!! even after an operation with a safety pin, the slipper wouldnt hold, so we just had to hire an auto and go home.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">and we haven't give up on this quest. as yet. we'll go back and find out where Y lives. even if its the last thing we do.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">and Y (:x) if u r reading this.. unna pathi illa ithu :D unnai pathi lam ezhuthuvena, public a? blog la lam? chumma.. ithu vera yara pathiyo!! ;)</p>
