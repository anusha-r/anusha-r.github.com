a post after a loooon time.. not that i have been busy wid placement preps ( tis is one highly overconfident soul dreaming of being placed in a 'biggie' :P )

my 6th sem results came on may28 or so.. got 9.042, totaly unexpected for tat disastrous semester.. not complaining :), but as USUAL, ' i will do this 7th sem very well..' :)) lets see if i remember this resolution atleast in this penultimate sem ;)

btw, feisty fawn replaced dapper drake on my computerÂ  today :) I am only a newbie so cant say more than this at this stage :P

placement preps have taken a downward plunge and so has my TopCoder score :( 1045 from 1066 in today's srm.. graduating to a blue coder is delayed once again..

and am attending CTS on monday for the first slot of placements..  most of my friends attended tcs today and hearing their stories, i doubt if i'll so much as clear the written :( Have to put these 2 days to good use.. :|

coming to why i have posted after a long time , seeing the many tech blogs on the net, many of which have been very useful to me, i am thinking of blogging more about tech stuff rather than the usual yadda yadda :))

My home page has been updated to reveal this secret blog to the world :P :P .. yup, www.geocities.com/pyramids2500 is up and pointing to this blog.. its still a wordpress-protected blog, so it remains to be seen if any non-wordpress person wud sign up and see ;) According to webwait ( http://webwait.com/ ) my site takes 11.42 s to download.. but tats because of the (u'll say this once u see the site 'soooperb') pics i stole from someone's flickr album :))

tats all for today folks, am goin back to looking at aptitude questions for cts ( pah, i hate it.. its gobbling up hours that cud have been spent usefully at spoj/topcoder :P )

cheers,
