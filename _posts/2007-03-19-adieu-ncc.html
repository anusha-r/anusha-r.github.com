march 18, 2007.. i have   completed my three years with the <strong>4[TN] Naval Technical Unit</strong>, Anna University.. let me recollect those never-again-in-life opportunities i had as a naval cadet..
<p>
2004 -
<p>
the admission form in my hand had a column for extra curricular activities and students had to choose one. one of the options was 'Ncc Navy (for girls)' .. i had no idea about the NCC at that time..i just imagined being taken to visit ships and ticked it on an impulse.. the girl next to me (Srividya.. :) ) said that NCC would be tough and that NSS would be less straining.. before i could think again (thankfully ;) ), i was called to the front and directed to the NCC table (and only in my third year did i realise the efforts that went into this recruitment drive..).  was happy to see my school senior (Prasanna anna) there.. he asked me the reason for choosing NCC ..and as usual i just smiled in rply, thinking it would be too childish to say 'i thought i would be taken to visit ships' :P he just smiled back and let me go..
<p>
the day was a friday , the last day of the 3 day orientation for freshers..the announcement said that all students willing to join the NCC had to report at 8 the next day near the NCC unit..was happy to learn that my schoolmate Sarada (later, the GI topper) had taken NCC too..(it later turned out that i was one of the very few who had taken NCC without knowing what the routine was.. :P  ) . We were asked to run around the ece dept (one of the regular routes for warmup for the next two years).. dont know how i was able to hold my own that day, without having been interested in any kind of sport right from school.. thinking it over, there have been numerous occasions where i have held on to the NCC without just coming out.. wonder why!! ;)
<p>
then started the 20 parade year- uniforms issued, basic commands were taught, the usual "punishments" (until now it has been 'run until the eee dept and come back'  and i guess it wont change in the near future too :P ), "absenteeism  will be dealt with severely" (heard the word for the first time here :D ) ,  the breakfasts at the canteen (yummmy.. :P ), the technical classes (we had a lot of them as first years, when compared to later batches.. our fault?), the cultural activities before these classes (again, something which has not been held since - thanks to our ex - CO? ), the punishments i received for absenteeism - twice: sep 11 and jan 30 or 31 ( i dint even know there was a parade going on.. lol), the RD parade practice in the evenings before jan26, the visit to INS Rajali at arakonam, the ATC camp period, firing (one of my favorite activities) and finally the 8th NTAC- Naval Technical Attachment Camp 2005 ..
<p>
the NTAC is the highlight of NCC Navy.. the preparations must have  begun  as early as january ,but our first muster about this was in march.. suddenly our third years were not there and second years seemed to be in charge ( i never knew until much later that the third years' tenure had ended :P ). we were taken for the reservation on a tuesday in april.. it was raining heavily that day.. i came back fully drenched to attend the evs assess.. we had our CO's briefing on april 15th evening.. of course, i was more worried about my semester which began on may 6 and was wondering why everybody was so serious about a camp that was more than a month away .. :P
<p>
then came the semester holidays.. a 10 day gap before the camp began.. throughout march and april we had been told about the physical activities at the camp and asked to practice seriously.. i had planned quite a few things  like walking upto the station everyday, etc  :P  .. finally i ended with having a half an hour skipping session for a month as my preparation for the camp..
<p>
<strong>NTAC 2005</strong> - may 30 to jun 14 - ND(V) and INS Shivaji (Lonavla) - my NCC notebook  would give a more detailed account of the happenings, so i will write a separate post about the wonderful time i had at the camp..
<p>
and after camp, it was 'shramdhan' (cleaning), inspection of the unit ( who could forget the 'flag areas' done by the SW :P ) it was the most wonderful time in all my three years .. just our seniors and us.. not to mention 'Operation Agnikand', a play about first aid and fire fighting, conceived by our CO and CCs(i guess) and enacted before the Group Commander.. he liked it so much that we staged it once again before the DDG of our directorate..
<p>
we had to do the ID parade without first years, as their counseling was also delayed like our batch was..  then came the recruitment and selection, the same 20 parade routine, though we dint seem to have as many parades or activities as we had in our first year..poor batch, they dint get a chance to do firing or attend ATC or visit INS Rajali..but they did get a chance to sail on board INS Amba , something we did only in our camp.. One of the most enjoyable events was the Boat Pulling event we went for in Dec 2005.. with just our seniors and CO..what a wonderful time it was.. :)   Jan 2006 was hectic as usual, with RD practice. We had our B certificate exam in Feb 2006, followed by C certificate for seniors in march.. and before i knew it, we were called to the unit and the camp preference list announced..!! thus began the preparations for NTAC 2006...
<p>
NTAC 2006 - deserves a special post, complete with pictures ;)
<p>
finally, my third year with NCC.. the same routine, only this time i had to be on the other side, facing the cadets ..  ;)    We had inspection sometime in August and enacted the same Operation Agnikand.. we were taken to IIT almost every evening to practice and it was just great.. the mistakes we kept doing after so many rehearsals, the way we kept substituting new people every rehearsal.. finally they ended up with a 'not so  good' performance on the D Day at IITM on Aug 25.. the second years cadets who were not willing to continue for the second year officially had this as their last parade (though almost all of them decided to bid adieu without prior notice much before this parade..)
<p>
we had an anti-tobacco awareness campaign (oct 2006)  and firing early in the year (sep 2006).. but try as much, we just couldnt accomodate a visit to INS Rajali in the routine..  :(  Boat pulling was held in Dec 2006, but i couldnt attend as i was at coimbatore then, participating in the Asia Regionals of ACM ICPC... :(
<p>
Jan was taken up by the rifle drill for RD, and we being third years, managed to stay away from rifle drill :P .. that has been one area best left to the SD ..  But then we third years managed to stay out of all warm ups, punishments (most of them) and drill of any sort..something our seniors never did   :P . Then came the B certificate training for the second years and after that.. this thursday, friday when we had classes for C certificate, followed by our practical exam yesterday and written today..
<p>

<p>
it was an atmosphere of celebration when we mustered at the unit after the exam.. SD lifting their Cadet Captains by their arms and  kickingthem :P , cadets taking photographs with the DK Whalers of the unit, the Group Commander's black ambassador :P , someone collecting everyone's email ids..
<p>
the Group Commander, Group Captain A K Singh spoke for a few minutes about the strength of these relationships and how we should nurture them .. we met all the PI staff ( who are almost always scolding on the parade ground and turn out to be  a great help during the exams, be it written or practical :P ) and with a final snap covering the unit, came out of the unit.. :|
<p>
we might have a muster this week to properly hand over to our juniors.. and then my last visit would probably be when i  return my uniforms..
<p>
i wouldnt have any more of those saturday parades, no more 8As, no firing, no namelists, no canteen letters, no more evening musters.. suddenly i would have time for everything i had wanted to do ( more time with acm, mipt, etc.. ). Nothing would come close to all those wonderful moments i had had as an NCC cadet.. but since my class overlooks the unit, i would be seeing most of the musters, i guess..
<p>
<em>the show must go on... and it will..</em>
