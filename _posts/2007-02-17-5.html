hmm.. well, about this sixth semester in computer science..

this one's really tough with 3 labs ( r they tuf or hav i lost interest? :| )  and a mini project in almost every one of those subjects - c# (still searching) , graphics, graph theory (wrote an abstract about half an hour before the deadline, but...) and not to mention the final year project.. ppl hav already decided on the team and guide it seems..i am late as usual.. ;)

apart from studies, my three year stint with ncc will be coming to end in two to three weeks :( . Will definitely miss those parades and musters, which r usually held in the assessment week :)

and coming to coding, i participated in the acm regionals at coimbatore (teammates: aruna and shanmugapriya) last sem and it was just great.. we came 15th (but then those four questions we solved were the usual ones and most teams managed to solve those..). lots of opcs r coming up -  <a href="http://www.abacus2k7.org">abacus</a>, <a href="http://www.cs-mit.org/cb07">carte blanche</a> and inscription.. hope to do well in those..

will (hopefully) post something more cheerful tomorrow (IF i get good ides for all those projects..)

cheers,
anusha
