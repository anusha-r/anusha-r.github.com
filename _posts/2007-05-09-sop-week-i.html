yup, a worst performance in c# signalled the end of semester 6 and the start of perhaps the most important hols in my college life..
<p>
and one of the ambitious plans is to do a grp study at coll.. had one session on monday, which we spent on reading the known probs in dp chapter of cormen... but have postponed all preps to next week and am starting to trichy tonight..
<p>
the annual religious trip to trichy.. gonna see oppiliappan, sri renganathar (two of my fav gods :) ), samayapuram and madurai meenakshi, if possible..
<p>
catch ya later
<p>
cheers,
<p>
