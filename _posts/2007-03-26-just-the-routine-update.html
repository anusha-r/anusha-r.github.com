well, am back after more than a week i think.. finally this second assess is coming to an end tomorrow [ reminds me, should go and learn xml.. :( ]

whew, what a week this has been.. so much for this final year project which we will be doing in the next two semesters..looked up something about swarm intelligence and ant colony optimization for the proposal that i am to submit tomorrow.. am not sure if it will be accepted, but anyways.. its my fault, should have started looking up ideas as soon as i heard ppl were looking for teammates..

and coming to those other 6th semester projects, well, two more have been added to the list.. we now have graph theory(computer chess.. i think mam is pretty satisfied with the topic.. she gave us a chance to redo the second phase report rather than giving the  ZERO it deserved;) ), graphics and multimedia (my idea is sure to be rejected:D ), digital signal processing (gonna borrow from the it people, one week is the given time..), web technology (am happy about this one, i know jsp.. :) ) and C#.Net (Xbox game.. to be shown by march 12th :( ).. hmm..should complete them all..not like the toc project i did last year around this time.. i got a (very poor) 11 , even though i had started looking it up about one month before..

so thats about it.. should get hold of a nice faculty (read one with a PhD).. march 9 is the deadline for submission of proposals.. hope everything goes on well...cant  take it if life at ceg ends with a project under any other teacher [ :(  :(  :(  ]

and now to dive into XML...

cheers,
