Hello There !
<p>
Back after a loong time (yeah, I'll blame that on my work as always, and not on my laziness) . It's that time of the year (once again!) where you suddenly wake up and realise you havent done much for having so loong on this planet.. and take the same resolutions you took last year (and the year before) with gusto.
<p>
Erm.. those two lines are pretty depressing :D But then, 2008 has been anything but that for me.. its the year I matured (now, did I?)  from a 'college-kid' to (ahem) professional =)) .. the year that saw the Witches in FULL form (more on that later.. it would take a bigger post to do justice to those doing ;) ).. and the year that has been many things to many people :P
<p>
A small recap of 2008, for my friends, fans and foes (he he :D)..
<p>
January -
<p>
Its been a 'buggy' year for me :D and the bugs began in Jan with Kurukshetra =)) 'Spot the Bug' is , well, the thing that laid a strong foundation for the witches in our class [ I wonder how many hate mails I'll get after this post :))] To be brief, we 'participated' in the debugging event of Kurukushetra, while our college was the host.. 'participated' not for ourselves, but to 'spice' up things a bit for our class. Well, well, what a success it was :)) I'll put up the pics too, later :D
<p>
And we, team Chocolat (in programming circle - Aruna, Shanmuapriya and I) , got to visit IIT Karaghpur for an overnight programming contest - What fun it was! Surely, there cant be many places colder than that one! We had wrapped ourselves in a couple of tee shirts over our salwars, one or blankets, socks and mufflers. We took a pic of that 'get-up' but thats sure to put any horror movie to shame, so that wont appear in this blog :P
<p>
Most of all.. that thing called 'fyp'.. That was the only plague in those wonderful last few months of college life :D We had our first review in Jan.. and not surprisingly we had to redo it! well, you do have to pay at sometime if you spend all your time in canteen / coffee shop and call that 'working for fyp' :))
<p>
February -
<p>
Techofes !  Stayed overnight at hostel for a few days..only the scond time in college, after my first year. Though we were punished with 'Bheema' the events after we returned to hostel more than made up for that!! You'll never know how a simple 'truth-or-dare' game would reveal soooo much! of course, that was beacause one of the participants in the game went overboard with their honesty!! :))
<p>
Feb 2k8 also saw the Witches hunt for the one salwar that all of us would buy a piece of.. More of that in march!
<p>

Isn't a pic worth a thousand words - here's the big thing we did in march -

and then, the final internal review of our fyp came and went :D :)) Its still a surprise to us on how we were given B in fyp :))
<p>
April -
<p>
Interviewed with Amazon! Had a WONDERFUL birthday bash at Ascendas (it was on the day of amzn written, you know!) And yeah, we wore that witches dress for some exam :)) Exams went well, as usual.. had to think so much to cook up some sensible stuff that I dint complete all the questions in many exams :))
<p>
May -
<p>
Month of treats.. And the external review for fyp =)) What a<span style="text-decoration:line-through;"> tragedy</span> comedy it was!! After college (I had no feelings at all then.. of leaving college.. that took some time to sink in!) it was the annual trip to sri rangam and then preps for joining amazon :)) , followed by joining on may 26.

Yeah, you got it - Life has been dreary, dull, boring, what not? December was a bit ok.. We witches met at Bangalore.. (which, If I take my resolutions seriously, stop being lazy, etc, would soon be a blog post) Had a wonderful  weekend there.. Followed by our first glimpse of corporate Christmas celebrations.
