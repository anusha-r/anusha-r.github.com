Had a memorable evening at MIT on Friday - it was our Graduation Day, our turn to wear that yellow robe :)
<p>
Preparations for a bash at convocation had begun much early :D Trust us witches to use even the smallest opportunity to show our gethu :)) After the er, slightly disastrous comments for the 'uniform' we wore last march (an older post has the pic), we took some care this time to choose a better dress. We spent some time on this hunt when a few of us had gone to visit the Bangalore witches last december. Needless to say, a lot of heads turned this time too (though not many negative comments about our selection this time.. or was it that no one was interested? :D ). And fortunately the 'concerned' people forgot to discuss the weight loss challenge between chennai and blore witches :))
<p>
Coming to the event, I joined the witches at MIT (after aÂ  *lite* breakfast that other witches will attest to :D). We managed to escape the rehearsal session and visit their canteen. But then the main event also turned out to be such a bore that we could have safely stayed away from that hangar. We were given our certificates rather unceremoniously before the event started. Worst of all, they actually gave a printed copy of the chief guest's address to the audience, before he event started talking.
<p>
Met a lot of folk at MIT and of course, heard a lot of gossip too.. it did go well, though I had this feeling of not having done better at college - for someone who has regularly been in the proficiency prize queue at school right from 4th standard to be nowhere near it all at college.. sniff !
<p>
=))

As an aside, I have been reading a highly interesting "A Short History of Nearly Everything". My first book outside fiction and am enjoying it thoroughly.

cheers,
