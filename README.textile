bq. Hello!

This is the repo of my personal blog with Github pages, <a href="http://anusha-r.github.com">anusha-r.github.com</a>.
I have been blogging since 2007 with wordpress and moved to Github in Oct 2011.

GH gives me a clean, only-my-content place, a chance to learn git and makes me want to write more posts, yet another time.
